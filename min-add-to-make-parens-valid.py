"""A parentheses string is valid if and only if:

It is the empty string,
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.
You are given a parentheses string s. In one move, you can insert a parenthesis at any position of the string.

For example, if s = "()))", you can insert an opening parenthesis to be "(()))" or a closing parenthesis to be "())))".
Return the minimum number of moves required to make s valid.

Example 1:
Input: s = "())"
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: s = "((("
Output: 3

Example 3:
Input: s = "()"
Output: 0

Example 4:
Input: s = "()))(("
Output: 4"""
